# MyToken

MyToken is a Solidity smart contract that represents a custom token. It allows minting and burning of tokens, as well as tracking balances and total supply.

## Description

The MyToken contract is a Solidity smart contract that implements a custom token on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to mint new tokens and burn existing tokens, while keeping track of token balances and the total token supply.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To execute the MyToken program in an Ethereum IDE, you can follow these steps:

1. Open your preferred Ethereum Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as Remix or Truffle.
2. Create a new Solidity file and name it MyToken.sol.
3. Copy and paste the provided code into the MyToken.sol file.
4. Compile the contract to ensure there are no syntax errors. If any errors occur, review and fix them accordingly.
5. Deploy the contract by selecting the appropriate environment (e.g., JavaScript VM, Injected Web3, or Localhost) in your Ethereum IDE.
6. Choose an account to act as the deployer of the contract.
7. Specify any required parameters, such as the _address and _value for minting or burning tokens.
8. Interact with the contract by calling the mint and burn functions with the desired arguments.
9. Monitor the console or transaction logs for any output or errors.
